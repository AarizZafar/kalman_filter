### Kalman Filter Overview

The **Kalman Filter** is an iterative mathematical process that uses a set of equations and a series of consecutive data inputs to estimate the true state (such as **position**, **velocity**, etc.) of a system.
It is particularly useful when measurements are affected by **random errors**, **uncertainties**, or **unpredictable variations**.

This method combines predictions from a model with noisy measurements to produce estimates that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone.
